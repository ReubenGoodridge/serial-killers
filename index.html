He got away with it for so long as many people thought his victims (mainly older women) wouldn't live much longer anyway.<br><br> The Shipman Inquiry found that he had likely killed around 218 people with this method however, he was only convicted of 15 counts due to many of the other corpses being too far decomposed to still contain any of the diamorphine compound. </h3>

      <h2 id="opinion">I think that Shipman's punishment was correct as he killed hundreds of people. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whole_life_order">Whole Life Order</a> meant that he would've spend the rest of his life in prison. However, I believe he should've been better guarded and treated as he hung himself in prision to get out of his sentence. He also timed his suicide to allow his wife to claim his NHS pension which I don't think should've been allowed to happen; instead, the money in that pension should have been invested back into the NHS or given to the families of victims of Shipman.</h2>
